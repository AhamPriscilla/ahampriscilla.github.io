                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Due to the global pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, visits to public places were either completely
                    prohibited or severely restricted in order to prevent the spread of the virus.
                    However, as the management and prevention of the virus continue to improve, the strict limits on
                    movement are being eased.
                    <br>
                    This is especially exciting for fun-loving people who have felt trapped since the start of the
                    lockdown,
                    as they anticipate possibilities to resume their social activities and restore as much normalcy to
                    their
                    lives as possible.
                    <br>
                    While these customers are ready to resume their lives, businesses that cater to large crowds still
                    have
                    a lot of work to do in terms of managing their post-lockdown operations to ensure it adheres to
                    pandemic
                    guidelines, protects the health of their customers, employees, and does not impede their profits.
                    <br>
                    This presents a challenge for movie cinemas, that still rely significantly on in-person movie
                    ticketing.
                    This service style readily converts to long lines, a significant health risk to workers and
                    customers,
                    and a potential source of poor customer experience.

                <h3>My Role & Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    I handled this project as the Ux, Interaction, and UI Designer.  I assumed full responsiblity
                    for all user research and unmoderated usability testing, for which there were 14 participants. 
                    <br>
                    With the guidiance of a mentor and feedback from the participants, I was able to realize this project.
                    <br>It took a total of 10 weeks to complete.

                <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
                <p>
                    I began the process by asking questions. I conducted research to determine who the customers
                    are and the available alternatives they utilized to purchase their movie tickets. 
                    <br>
                    Following my finding from secondary research, customer feedbacks, and personal observations
                    from my visits to the cinema, the demography for moviegoers is largely of young adults; 
                    mostly females, who go to the movies (particularly in groups) for the social experience, 
                    as a means to relax, network, or make a social statement.
                </p>

                <h3>Finding Answers</h3>
                <p>
                    To understand app user experience with current alternatives customers relied on,
                    I visited the websites of major cinemas in the city and downloaded the only available movie
                    ticketing app at the moment.
                    <br>
                    Getting to experience the alternatives allowed me understand some of the pain points
                    experienced by customers as they tried to book thier tickets using these available methods.
                    With the help of the <span style="font-style: italic;">"How might we approach"</span>, I was able to find ideas that allowed
                    me how ideas could be alligned with goals.
                    <br>
                    The major pain point users experienced as deduced from feedbacks on Playstore were:
                <ul class="for-the">
                    <li style="font-style: italic;">"The app is only setup for club memeberships....just pay for your
                        ticket
                        when you visit the cinema in-person."</li>
                    <p>Considering this, how might we... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"create an remote experience for users that alows them reach
                        their

                    <li style="font-style: italic;">"It is confusing to move around... been trying to get ticket for 2
                        days."

                    <p>Considering this, how might we... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"enable people to use their mobile devices to obtain the most

                    Taking the user pain points as a guide I decided what actions and features would be crucial and
                    beneficial to achieving their goal. I opted to design a sitemap around these conclusions.
                    <br>
                    I devised an eight-step method to ticket purchasing with the aim of achieving an experience that is

                    focused and simple. The design drafts focuses on enabling the target customers achieve their goals

                    booking and paying for their tickets in no more than eight steps -

                    recieved valuable

                    <br>
                    The test focused on 3 major aspects:
